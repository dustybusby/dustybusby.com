                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>Hi there! I'm Dusty, a web designer with a knack for creativity, a love for problem-solving, and a few too many tabs open at any given moment. Welcome to the page where I share a little about myself and how I got here!</p>

                    <h2>Why Web Design?</h2>
                    <p>It all started with a simple question: Why are some websites so fun to use, while others make you want to throw your laptop out the window? The answer? Good design.</p>

                    <p>Web design is the perfect blend of art and strategy. It's where creativity meets problem-solving, where a good idea turns into something tangible, and where small decisions - like the color of a button - can make a huge impact.</p>

                    <p>I love the challenge of turning chaos into clarity. Whether it's arranging content so it makes sense, creating layouts that guide the eye, or crafting interactions that just feel right, web design is my way of making the digital world a little easier (and a lot more beautiful) for everyone.</p>

                    <p>Plus, there's nothing more satisfying than seeing something you created come to life on the web, knowing it's helping someone find what they need, learn something new, or just smile for a second. It's the kind of work that feels like play - and that's why I'm here.</p>

                    <h2>My Journey</h2>
                    <h3>From Presales Engineer to Pixel-Perfect Visionary</h3>
                    <p>In my past life (career-wise), I worked at companies like Okta and One Identity, crafting identity systems that were as secure as they were user-friendly. Here's what I brought to the table:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A deep dive into understanding user personas (aka "How do people actually use this thing?").</li>
                        <li>A sharp focus on consumer identity for websites, boosting conversions, and keeping users happy.</li>
                        <li>Strategic communication, aka figuring out how to explain tech stuff to non-tech folks (a superpower in web design, trust me).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>From IT Architect to Creative Problem-Solver</h3>
                    <p>I also leveled up with roles at The Coca-Cola Company and HCA Healthcare, managing IT infrastructures that spanned the globe. We're talking data centers, server pools, and the cloud (no, not the fluffy kind). My work included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Juggling methodologies like Agile, DevOps, and whatever else came my way.</li>
                        <li>Crafting technical diagrams that turned complex ideas into "Oh, now I get it!" moments.</li>
                        <li>Navigating between teams and tools with the finesse of a professional cat herder.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>How It All Connects</h2>
                    <p>Now, I take all those experiences and channel them into creating amazing websites. Here's how my past life gives me a leg up:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User-Centric Design: Whether it's an identity system or a website, it's always about the user (aka you're the star of the show).</li>
                        <li>Empathy and Listening: I've spent years listening to customer needs and turning them into solutions. Now I do it with a bit more color and CSS.</li>
                        <li>Visual Storytelling: My experience with diagrams now fuels wireframes and prototypes that tell stories and solve problems.</li>
                        <li>Tech Know-How: From scripting languages to design tools, I've got the technical chops to bring ideas to life.</li>
                        <li>Teamwork (and Coffee): I thrive in collaborative environments, whether working with designers, developers, or marketing wizards.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Let's Talk Web Design</h2>
                    <p>At the heart of it all, I'm here to create websites that feel like home for users: visually stunning, super functional, and easy to navigate (even for someone's tech-challenged cousin). My goal? To make the web a more beautiful, functional, and delightful place - one pixel at a time.</p>

                    <p>When I'm not designing, you'll probably find me sipping Mt. Dew, doodling ideas, playing online games, or chasing the perfect music playlist to match my current project.</p>

                    <p>Thanks for stopping by! If you've got a project, an idea, or just want to talk about the latest in web trends (or memes), reach out!</p>
