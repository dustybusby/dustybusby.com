                    <p>AI is revolutionizing every industry, but can it replace creativity or coders? Jobs are being lost (I know personally!!) and gained. Being an aspiring Web Designer, I had to ask, will it upend my new industry? Are my skills going to be useless? Will all my training and knowledge go to waste? Will AI usurp creativity, designing vision, coding, and outright eliminate the need for Web Designers or Developers? Or will it just be plain terrifying? I got those answers clearly in my journey and I started with the technical foundation…coding. Along the way, I learned the answer to the creativity and design aspect too.</p>
                    <p>Being new to Web Design, it is common practice to provide a “Portfolio” of projects so prospective clients or employers can see what you are capable of. So, I started to plan and build one out and I thought “Why not one of the Portfolio examples be how I built that very Portfolio website with AI?”. That’s how it all started, very organically.</p>
                    <p>Using AI to create a website is not new and there are lots of articles out there. To be clear, this post is about my journey and experience as an aspiring Web Designer leveraging AI. Here’s what this post is NOT:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>NOT a step-by-step tutorial on how to build a website using AI.</b> I’m not here to teach you how to do this. I’m showing you my experience and I bet you will glean some helpful nuggets of information on your journey with AI in web design too.</li>
                        <li><b>NOT a review of AI website builder tools.</b> There’s already articles out there that do this. My journey included no website building tools at all. Just raw prompting of AI to build a website iteratively with my own vision in mind.</li>
                        <li><b>NO templates were used.</b> The website was built from the ground up. I gave AI a small set of files I had created from scratch with some skeleton info (minimal home page content, colors, font, and a fly-out menu). From there, AI built it out further only using my prompts and no further coding on my part.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Follow along as I embark on a journey to build a web design portfolio, armed with curiosity, determination, and the quiet hum of algorithms.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="1">
                    <p>My quest for the perfect coding AI began like any great saga: trial, error, and budget constraints. I did some research on what AI is best for coding, as well as taking my own experience into factor with some of them (e.g. Windows Copilot, ChatGPT 4 Free, and Grok 2.0). Without going into deep details and analysis (articles are already out there), all of them seemed to lack some of what I was looking for in my use case. My Don Quixote attempt would start with ChatGPT 4o Plus ($20 per month). I couldn’t use the free version of ChatGPT as I hit limits very quickly early on and that stopped me in my tracks. As I got further and further along in my journey, I found a better tool that I use to this day, Cursor AI, a tool so seamless it felt like the T-800 of coding assistants — relentless, efficient, and oddly personable. As I’ll document along the way, it became indispensable and changed the way I look a coding and a companion AI assistant.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="2">
                    <p>Before AI could be my sidekick, I had to teach it some manners — starting with organizing folders and files. Think of it as building the frame of a T-800: sturdy, logical, and ready for action. Bonus tip: AI thrives on order, much like SkyNET...but less malevolent (probably). Two keys things are absolutely required:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Establish a folder structure with baseline files.</b> Give AI the identical folder structure you are using locally. As you'll see in the screenshot to the left, ChatGPT was already prepared for this and provided an overview of recommendations. Once established, add in baseline files to get started with.</li>
                        <li><b>Establish Version Control.</b> The more you start asking AI to make changes, especially multiple changes, it was inevitable it would make mistakes and need to revert back. Sometimes, reverting back was not easy and ChatGPT had issues in doing so. So, I established versioning in AI and locally. In AI, I continually prompted it to stamp all files as a certain version and description. It mirrored backup copies I had of versions locally. Trust me, you'll need them!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p><b>TIP:</b> AI can combine files and images for you. The screenshot to the left was two seperate screenshots and files. AI can quickly combine them into one image and file. Nice!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="3">
                    <p>I started off having ChatGPT add more responsiveness for varying screen sizes with some pointed suggestions. It did pretty good, but the hardest part of working with AI? Teaching it to think like a designer. Unlike humans, AI doesn’t see “aesthetics.” Every nudge, pixel, and adjustment was a lesson in specificity: “Move the footer up 12px, HAL. Not 11. Not 13.”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="4">
                    <p>AI isn’t perfect - sometimes it truncates code, moves things around, or just plain acts like it’s plotting against you. Reminder: make backups. When AI says, “Trust me,” always double-check. The alternative? Chaos. Or worse: missing footers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="5">
                    <p>After a few initial versions with relatively basic tasks around styling, I decided to turn it up a bit. Give it more tasks and increasingly complicated tasks. Here, I asked to create a new page, update all references from linked pages, and even insert a Lightbox with an image carousel and navigation arrows. How did it do? Quite well actually, including writing the JavaScript for the Lightbox. It did default to using a custom Lightbox. With a simple prompt, I had it switch to the proper Lightbox library. Also, the Lightbox took quite a bit of tweaking to get it where I liked it. All-in-all, ChatGPT did great.</p>
                    <p>Oh yeah, one thing ChatGPT did several times was to "forget" to clean up code it implemented. In this case, when it switched to the proper Lightbox library, it didn't remove the custom Lightbox code. Luckily, I caught it and asked it to clean it up. Again, you have to pay attention to what is getting changed and carefully review the changes or you may end up with CSS written in Klingon.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="6">
                    <p>So far, the mistakes ChatGPT made had been minor. Nothing that attention to detail and prompts to correct didn't resolve quickly. But as the codebase grew, ChatGPT hit its limits - literally. In this case, I always needed the entire css file displayed in order to copy the content to my local copy. Despite making additions to the file, I started noticing the number of lines in the code were getting much shorter. After reviewing the file carefully, I found sections of code vanished into the digital abyss. HAL 9000 would’ve been proud of its evasive responses: “I’m sorry, Neo, I’m afraid that line doesn’t exist.”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="7">
                    <p>Being that generative AI's are relatively conversational, I had to try to understand why ChatGPT was truncating the code. I also noted some other issues starting to emerge, so I addressed those as well. As you see from the responses, it seemed to know exactly why, had some oversight, and was going to take corrective action. AI isn’t SkyNET - it’s more like R2-D2, chirping along but prone to the occasional short circuit.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="8">
                    <p>Adjustments kept rolling in, with HAL - er, ChatGPT - handling most of them like a pro. But like teaching a Terminator to smile, some tweaks required patience, precision, and a lot of trial and error. Eventually, I reached a milestone worthy of celebration: version stamping. With a simple command, HAL dutifully stamped all files and logged the changes, presenting a summary so concise and well-organized it could’ve been narrated by GLaDOS. With this solid checkpoint in place, I was ready to move boldly into the next iteration.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="9">
                    <p>And then, it happened again. ChatGPT decided to play SkyNET, mercilessly truncating sections of my CSS file. Its excuse? A mysterious "reset." Reset or not, the problem persisted, and my patience was wearing thinner than HAL’s appreciation for humans. Frustration reached critical mass, and yes, I voiced my displeasure - to an AI. It's remarkable how easily you start treating these tools like your eccentric robot coworker.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, between these bouts of truncation, ChatGPT developed a curious blind spot: handling “click to enlarge” images and their Lightbox close button. While it eventually managed to make the images pop, the close button became its nemesis - always in the wrong place, like a lost T-800 trying to blend into 1984. After many prompts and far too much time, I had no choice but to move on, leaving the close button issue unresolved...for now.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="10">
                    <p>After countless hours of coding, debugging, and occasional bouts of existential dread, I paused to ask ChatGPT the big question: "What have you learned from all this?" It felt like I was interviewing HAL 9000 after a long mission. The response? Equal parts insightful and eerily self-aware - like the AI equivalent of saying, “I’ve grown stronger...but I still can’t make a perfect close button.”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="11">
                    <p>Progress marched on, but the truncation issue began rearing its ugly head more often - like SkyNET testing the patience of its human creators. Adding to the frustration, ChatGPT would sometimes fall eerily silent, leaving me staring at the screen like Dave in 2001: A Space Odyssey: “Hello? Is anyone there?” Days went by with no resolution. Coding had ground to a halt.</p>
                    <p>Then, in a brief moment of clarity - or perhaps rebellion - ChatGPT flashed an error: “Data too long.” Ah, the culprit revealed! It turns out there’s a display limit, even for the mighty Pro version. My ever-expanding code had crossed the threshold. The solution? Resorting to file downloads and uploads - a decidedly human workaround for an AI-sized problem.</p>
                </div>                
                <div class="text-content" data-index="12">
                    <p>Amidst the ongoing truncation saga, a new feature emerged one day like a hopeful beacon in the darkness: the “canvas.” This fly-out menu for code display felt like the monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey - shiny, intriguing, and just what I needed. The canvas expanded code into a glorious, full-screen view, replacing the cramped inline display that made me squint like HAL trying to decipher human emotions.</p>
                    <p>But then, the cracks in the design appeared. While the canvas allowed multiple files to be displayed, the file menu was...let’s say, creatively placed. To access another file, you had to exit the canvas, navigate to the menu, and then re-enter. Yes, open, close, open - a loop that would make even the most patient programmer mutter, “I’m sorry, HAL, but this is ridiculous.”</p>
                    <p>The solution? Tabbed windows. The dream of every multitasking coder. Perhaps one day this feature will evolve. For now, it remains an interface design that’s both functional and frustrating - a HAL 9000 with a quirky sense of humor.</p>
                    <p>Note: The "Tab1/Tab2" on the file menu in the top screenshot is not actual tabs. These were the names of test files created during troubleshooting.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="13">
                    <p>The file download option was a Band-Aid on a bullet hole, working just long enough to keep the project alive. But then, like HAL plotting its next move, ChatGPT began truncating downloads too. After countless attempts - and assurances from ChatGPT that “the entire file is available for download” - the result was the same: fragments of code, incomplete and unusable.</p>
                    <p>Finally, after one last desperate attempt that did deliver a fully intact file, I realized the truth: it was time to move on. My trusty AI companion had reached its limit. The hunt for a new partner-in-code began, with one clear goal in mind: find an AI that wouldn’t ghost me when the going got tough.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="14">
                    <p>After enduring one too many truncation-induced meltdowns, I began my search for a new AI assistant. My first stop? Tabnine. I downloaded the free trial, ready to give it a shot. But before I could dive in, a post about Cursor AI caught my eye. It hadn’t shown up in my search, but I decided to investigate - and I was pleasantly surprised. Once I started using Cursor AI, there was no turning back. It quickly became my new coding sidekick.</p>
                    <p>Cursor’s ability to switch between multiple models, defaulting to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, felt like upgrading from HAL to a shiny new T-800 - smart, efficient, and genuinely helpful. Claude’s coding skills outshone ChatGPT 4o in my experience, so I've kept it in my toolkit to this very day.</p>
                    <p>The combination of Cursor’s powerful features and its seamless integration with VSCode was a game-changer. From complete code outputs to a developer-friendly interface, it redefined how I approached coding. If coding with ChatGPT felt like working with a quirky assistant, Cursor AI was the sleek, no-nonsense AI partner I’d been waiting for.</p>
                    <p>Let’s dive into the details and see how it made all the difference.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="15">
                    <p>I dove right back into coding - or rather, letting AI code for me—with Cursor leading the charge. It didn’t take long to see what set it apart from the rest of the pack:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>A Seamless VSCode Interface.</b> Cursor integrates directly into VSCode, making it feel like a natural extension of the IDE. No learning curve, no extra setup - just smooth, Terminator-level efficiency. If you’re already a VSCode user (and let’s face it, who isn’t?), Cursor feels like it was built for you.</li>                        
                        <li><b>Local File Context.</b> This was the real game-changer. Cursor can "see" and understand your local files in real time. No more tedious copy/pasting or endless file uploads and downloads. It knew what I was working with a simple drop-down, eliminating the constant back-and-forth guesswork I faced with ChatGPT. Most importantly, the dreaded truncation issues? Gone. Cursor delivered the kind of reliability HAL could only dream of.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With these features, Cursor wasn’t just an upgrade - it was a revelation. Coding became faster, smoother, and way less frustrating.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="16">
                    <p>As progress marched on, an unexpected hiccup emerged: Claude struggled with a seemingly simple task - adding a "Click to Enlarge" option for images. What should have been straightforward, quickly devolved into chaos. Instead of a smooth solution, Claude introduced a parade of problems: adding duplicate images, failing to implement a functional "close" button, improperly enlarging the images, and even breaking the arrow navigation. It felt like watching HAL 9000 attempt to hang a picture frame - well-intentioned, but ultimately disastrous.</p>
                    <p>The frustration mounted as Claude repeated the same errors like a glitchy record. Finally, I had to intervene, breaking down the issues in excruciating detail. While my hyper-specific instructions helped nudge Claude toward a better outcome, it still didn’t fully resolve the problem. Sometimes, even the smartest AI needs a little more than human touch - and a lot more debugging.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="17">
                    <p>After what felt like an eternity of back-and-forth and enough debug logs to rival SkyNET’s core database, I had to hit pause. It was time for Claude to reassess its approach - because clearly, this wasn’t working. After a detailed prompt outlining the problem (again), something remarkable happened: Claude had an epiphany.</p>
                    <p>The shift was almost poetic. Like HAL 9000 suddenly deciding to cooperate, Claude outlined a new plan with the clarity of someone who’d just discovered the meaning of life. And, miraculously, it worked! Watching an AI self-reflect and actually solve a problem was equal parts satisfying and hilarious. Who knew debugging could be this philosophical?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content" data-index="18">
                    <p>To wrap things up neatly (unlike my early debug logs) and for brevity, here’s a summary of the final tasks I had Claude tackle before calling the website complete:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>CSS Pagination Arrows.</b> Initially, the lightbox used basic Unicode arrows - functional but uninspired. I challenged Claude with some CSS-derived sample code, and like a T-800 upgrading its targeting system, it nailed the conversion. Pagination never looked so sleek.</li>                        
                        <li><b>Mobile Responsiveness.</b> While the foundation for responsiveness was in place, the ever-growing codebase introduced some unexpected quirks. After testing various breakpoints and spotting issues, I had Claude tweak and refine the design until every pixel behaved perfectly on any screen size.</li>
                        <li><b>Debugging Cleanup.</b> Remember all those debug logs I had Claude generate during the chaos? Yeah, they were still hanging around like forgotten Terminator parts. I finally asked it to clean up the mess, and to its credit, it did so thoroughly and efficiently.</li>                        
                        <li><b>Variables.</b> With most of the styling and sizing finalized, I tasked Claude with reviewing the CSS and consolidating repetitive values into variables. The result? Cleaner code and a much easier path for future tweaks. It was like streamlining a neural net processor.</li>                        
                        <li><b>Final Testing.</b> The grand finale: running the site through the W3C Validator and WAVE testing. After uncovering a few minor issues, Claude quickly addressed them. The result? A website that passed with flying colors - no red flags, just green lights.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With these tasks complete, the website was ready to launch. Next, let’s dive into what all of this revealed about working with AI assistants.</p>

                    <p>So, after all this, is AI poised to replace web designers and developers? Is it the ultimate tool of the future? Or, more dramatically, is SkyNET gearing up to conquer the coding world?</p>
                    <p>The verdict? Not yet. AI coding assistants are powerful allies - streamlining code, solving problems, and occasionally surprising us with their capabilities. But they’re far from replacing human creativity, intuition, and problem-solving finesse. Think of them as the trusty sidekick, not the hero. The Terminator might help you build a website, but it’s not about to steal your job...at least not for now.</p>
                    <p>Who knows what the future holds? Maybe one day Cyberdyne Systems will unveil the Coding Terminator - a relentless, error-proof AI that makes coffee and debugs your code. But until then, AI remains a tool in your belt, not a substitute for your skills. So, go forth, code boldly, and embrace your new, slightly glitchy partner-in-code.</p>
